WHAT IS SUPER KEYWORD:
    Super keyword in java is used to refer to the parent class object.
    Is use only when a constructor is present in a parent class
    to call this constructor inside a child class we use super keyword.
WHY SHOULD WE LEARN SUPER KEYWORD:
    1) If we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we
    can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because by default java
    prefer the variable of child class. We can also call the super class constructor
    with the help of super with parenthesis super();
HOW TO USE SUPER KEYWORD:
    1)We can use super. method name or field name to call the method or to access the field of  super class.
    2)Use the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.
Rules:
    1)We can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with the help of super keyword.
    2)We can only use supe(); inside a constructor.
    3)When we have a constructor in parent class you must have a constructor in child class as well
     in order to use the extend keyword. All the fields must be linked. otherwise you'll get an ERROR.
     If you have more than one constructor in parent class you must at least create a constructor in child class
     that matches one of the constructors in parent class does not matter the size does not have to be the  bigger one.
    4)If we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching parameter
     constructor inside the child classes as well.
    5)super() should be the first line inside a constructor after creating a child class.
    6)IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CONSTRUCTOR IN PARENT CLASS YOU MUST CREATE AT LEAST ONE MATCHING CONSTRUCTOR INSIDE CHILD CLASS AS WELL
    IT CAN ALSO BE A EMPTY CONSTRUCTOR=> userInfo(){}

 Once you have created a constructor java will no longer provide a default constructor.

 WHAT IS METHOD OVER LOADING:
 CHEK POINTS
 1)Name should match
 2)Parameters should match
 3)Data type should match in the same order/sequence.

 *SAME RULES AS CONSTRUCTORS
 WE CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE METHOD WITH SAME PARAMETERS
 BUT IT MUST HAVE DIFFERENT DATA TYPE OR DIFFERENT SEQUENCE CHECK (Class MethodOverloanding) FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING.

    When same name method exist in a class but with different number of parameters, different data type
    and different sequence of parameters it is called MethodOverloanding.
    You must have different parameters so java knows which methods you are referring to.

 WHY WE SHOULD USE MethodOverloanding:
   1)Makes your code more redable.
   2)Makes the life of the end users easy they do not have to memorize many method names.

 HOW CAN WE USE  MethodOverloanding:
         We can have same name methods but we have to fallow the bellow rules.
         1) By passing different number of parameters.
         2) We can change the datatype of parameters.
         3) We can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.

ACCESS MODIFIERS:
   Access modifiers are keywords in Java that help us controls the access of
   *classes, variables, methods and other code of block.
   There are four access levels in Java
  -private-->most restricted
  -default(it's not a keyword)-->not  keyword
  -protected
  -public.
  We have three keywords that define these access levels
  1) private
  2) protected
  3) public.
PRIVATE:
    When we use the private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible inside that class.
    it is the most restricted access modifier.
    *We should make the methods private but not the class.
DEFAULT(its not a keyword):
    when we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default access is applied
    by java which means.
    We can access this variable or method:
    *inside the same class as well as in all the other classes which exists inside the same package.
    *CAN NOT BE ACCESS IN ANOTHER PACKAGE
PROTECTED:
    When we have protected access modifier.
    We can access that method or variable:
    *inside the same class
    *inside the other classes which are inside the same package
    *inside the classes which are in different packages as well
    **but they must have extends relationship with the original class.
PUBLIC:
    When we use the public access modifiers we can use that field or method anywhere inside
    the same project.
    We can access them:
     *in the class
     *in the package
     *in other packages
     *in the project.
    ->It is accessible anywhere across the project.
IMPORT KEYWORD:
     WE CAN ONLY IMPORT CLASSES NOT INDIVIDUAL FIELDS
     WHEN TRYING TO USE FIELDS FROM ANOTHER CLASS FROM DIFFERENT PACKAGE, IMPORTING THAT CLASS IS A MUST
     This must be done when trying to access a class from a different package.

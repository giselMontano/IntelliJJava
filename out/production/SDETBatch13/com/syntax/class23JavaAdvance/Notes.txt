WHAT SI METHOD OVERRIDING IN JAVA:
    When same method with same header exists in the child class as well we call in method overriding.
WHY WE SHOULD OVERRIDE A METHOD:
    If we inherit from a class all the methods which are not private they are inherited in child class now if we do not like some
    of these methods may because they consume more
    internet bandwidth or consume a lot of CPU or uses a lot of memory we can override them
    the child class.
    We override for efficiency of the code.
HOW CAN WE USE METHOD OVERRIDING:
     1)We must inherit from a class.
     2)We can redeclare the method with same return, same header and provide the body of our choice.
EXAMPLE:

class Parent{

void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Beef");
}
void sleep(){
System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
}
}
class Child extends Parent{

void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Veggies");
}
}
RULES:
  1)We must have super class base relationship.
  2)Method in the parent and child class must have the same header, but they can be different in terms of access modifies and
   in very rear condition in terms of return type.
  3)We can not change the access modifier from public to protected or default, but we can do it in reverse order.
  4)Private method and constructors from parent class are not inherited into child class.
  5) If a method is static we use a different terminology it's called method redeclaration
      instead of overriding.
